You first book a flight (or multiple flights) by reserving seats. This creates a PNR(Passenger Name Record).

Then, you pay for that booking, which results in the issuance of a ticket. The ticket confirms your right to travel
on the reserved flight(s).

The flight is the actual journey you take.

Booking is like reserving a table at a restaurant.

Ticket is like paying for your meal at that reserved table.

Flight is the actual dining experience itself.
