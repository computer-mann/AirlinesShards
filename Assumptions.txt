I am assuming that travellers dont choose their own seats
A seat will be assigned to a traveller by the system
A traveller can be assigned a seat only if the seat is available
A traveller can be assigned a seat only if the traveller has paid for the ticket
A traveller can only choose the date they want to travel

   - **User Cancellation**: The user can cancel the booking within a certain time frame.
   - **System Cancellation**: The booking is automatically canceled if payment is not completed within a certain time frame.
   - **Payment**: The user enters payment information.
   - **Confirmation**: The booking is confirmed, and the user receives a booking confirmation.
   - **Seat Assigned**: A seat is assigned to the user (if applicable).

2. **Pre-Travel**:
   - **Ticket Issued**: The user receives an electronic ticket (e-ticket).
   - **Check-in Open**: Online check-in opens (usually 24-48 hours before departure).
   - **Checked In**: The user checks in online or at the airport.
   - **Boarding Pass Issued**: The user receives a boarding pass.

3. **Travel Day**:
   - **At the Airport**: The user arrives at the airport.
   - **Baggage Drop**: The user drops off checked luggage.

Throughout these stages, there may also be additional statuses related to changes or disruptions, such as:
