## 4. Technical Assumptions

**Assumptions were made in pre-filling this section based on common enterprise practices. Please note any areas needing more specific input.**

### 4.1 Repository Structure: Polyrepo

*Rationale:* Given the potential for distinct services (e.g., booking, flight operations, maintenance), a polyrepo approach allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of services.

### 4.2 Service Architecture

**CRITICAL DECISION**

The system will leverage a **microservices architecture** deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). This architecture allows for independent development teams, scalable components, and resilience. Core services will include:
* Flight Management Service
* Booking & Passenger Service
* Aircraft & Maintenance Service
* User & Authentication Service
* Reporting Service
A central API Gateway will manage external and internal traffic.

### 4.3 Testing Requirements

**CRITICAL DECISION**

**Full Testing Pyramid:**
* **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit test coverage (minimum 80% code coverage) for all backend and frontend components.
* **Integration Tests:** Integration tests for service-to-service communication and database interactions.
* **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Automated E2E tests for critical user journeys (e.g., booking a flight, checking in).
* **Manual Testing:** Specific scenarios requiring human interaction or subjective evaluation (e.g., complex UI flows, accessibility checks).
* **Performance Tests:** Load and stress tests to ensure the system meets NFRs for concurrent users and response times.

### 4.4 Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

* **Cloud Provider:** AWS will be the primary cloud provider, leveraging services like EC2, RDS (PostgreSQL), S3, Lambda, and API Gateway.
* **Backend Language/Framework:** Python with Django/FastAPI for services requiring rapid development and data manipulation.
* **Frontend Framework:** React or Angular for a modern, responsive single-page application (SPA) experience.
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD will be used for automated build, test, and deployment pipelines.
* **Containerization:** Docker for containerizing services, managed by Kubernetes (EKS) for orchestration.
* **Logging & Monitoring:** Centralized logging (e.g., CloudWatch, ELK stack) and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) will be implemented from Epic 1.
